### Hi!

I'm a cognitive scientist working at the Centre for Modern Interdisciplinary Technologies at Nicolaus Copernicus University, Toru≈Ñ, Poland. 
In my research I want to understand how the network organization and dynamics shape our experience (and vice versa). To achieve this goal, I combine achievements from network science, neuroimaging, and deep learning. I'm especially interested in discovering rules that govern the brain network reorganization during changing cognitive demands and learning. 

Beyond neuroscience, I'm passionate about music, human creativity, philosophy, nature, photography, dance, and mathematics. I love to play around with various instruments, especially analog synthesizers.
