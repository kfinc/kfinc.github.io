### Hi!

I'm a cognitive scientist working at the Centre for Modern Interdisciplinary Technologies at Nicolaus Copernicus University, Toruń, Poland. 
In my research I want to understand how the network organization and dynamics shape our experience. I’m also passionate about human creativity, music, philosophy, nature, photography, dance, and singing. I love to improvise in every domain of my life - from playing around with various musical instruments to combining seemingly distant concepts in science.
