### Hi!

I am cognitive neuroscientist working at the Centre for Modern Interdisciplinary Technologies at 
Nicolaus Copernicus University, Toruń, Poland. In October 2019 I obtained my Ph.D. in Physics at the Faculty of Physics,
Astronomy and Informatics, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń (thesis: *Dynamics and plasticity of human brain 
functional network during working memory task performance*). In my research I am interested how human learning 
and expertise are reflected in the organization of the human brain functional network. 
I enjoy data analysis (Python, R, MATLAB) and I am actively engaged in developing open-souce neuroimaging tools.
I spend my spare time on electronic music production, nature photography, reading, or having fun with my dogs.<br> <br>

### Research interest

* **Connectomics**: Plasticity of the human brain networks, reorganization of functional brain network during cognition
* **Neuroplasticity**: Experience-dependent plasticity, compensatory brain plasticity
* **Cognition**: Learning, offline memory replay, decision making, working memory 
* **Data science**: Network analysis, machine learning, data visualization, bayesian statistics
* **Open science**: Reproducible data processing pipelines, building open-source software
